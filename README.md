# fortran-hangman

I took a fortran77 hangman program and updated it to run on fortran95

Simply run `make` to create the executable and then run `./Hangman` to play a game a hangman

You can also run `make 77` to generate an executable for the fortran77 version (which can also be run with `./Hangman`

You can also run `make clean` to clean up the directory.
